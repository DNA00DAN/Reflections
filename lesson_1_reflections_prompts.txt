How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It was very easy no messy code to filter through.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

To go back will be so much easier especially if some broke along the way.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

With a manual save you obviously control the commit/save but when something really bad happens u have nothing to fall back on. But again with an 
auto-save, it might save at a later stage when its already too late to rollback.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is more coding based as a lot of our code is inter-related and it needs to track the changes across the board.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Its easier to compare when you actually look at both files at the same time.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

knowing i can just checkout an older branch if things go wrong makes things a bit easier.

How Do You Want to Use Git?

I want to use Git to keep my versions ordered and neat.
